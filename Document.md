%% Parameters
% Simulation time

Documentation
Project Description
The Secure Environment Surveillance System is designed to enhance security by integrating motion and temperature sensors with an alarm system. This MATLAB simulation evaluates sensor data and triggers an alarm when motion is detected or when the temperature exceeds a predefined threshold.

Workflow
Motion Detection: Randomly simulates motion presence (binary: 0 or 1).
Temperature Monitoring: Generates random temperature values with a threshold of 40째C.
Alarm Activation: Triggers an alarm when:
Motion is detected.
Temperature exceeds the threshold.
Visualization:
Motion sensor data.
Temperature variations with threshold indication.
Alarm status.
Graph Interpretations
Motion Sensor Data:

A stem plot showing motion detection over time (0 for no motion, 1 for motion).
Indicates areas of activity within the monitored environment.
Temperature Sensor Data:

A line plot showing temperature fluctuations.
Includes a threshold line to identify critical temperature breaches.
Alarm Status:

A stem plot indicating alarm activation.
Demonstrates system response to motion and temperature conditions.
Applications
Hospitals:

Monitor restricted areas and ensure patient safety.
Detect fires or unauthorized access.
Campuses:

Secure entrances, laboratories, and server rooms.
Ensure safety in case of emergencies.
Smart Cities:

Integrate with other security systems for public safety.
